        <h1>Bulls Eye Target Detection</h1>
    </header>

    <section>
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>The <strong>Bulls Eye Target Detection Project</strong> represents an advanced venture into the realm of computer vision and machine learning. With a focus on automating the identification and localization of Bulls Eye targets within images, this project leverages cutting-edge technologies to contribute to the field of image recognition and target tracking.</p>

        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>The project utilizes state-of-the-art deep learning techniques, prominently featuring the TensorFlow framework, to develop a sophisticated convolutional neural network (CNN). Trained on a meticulously curated dataset that includes labeled images, the CNN gains the ability to discern and generalize the distinctive features associated with Bulls Eye targets. This provides a foundation for accurate and efficient target detection.</p>

        <h2>Purpose</h2>
        <p>The primary purpose of the Bulls Eye Target Detection Project is to demonstrate the practical implementation of advanced machine learning methodologies in solving real-world challenges. By automating the process of target detection, the project aims to replace manual intervention in tasks traditionally reliant on human expertise. This, in turn, enhances efficiency, accuracy, and the overall capabilities of target detection systems.</p>

        <h2>Key Objectives</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Develop a robust CNN tailored for Bulls Eye target detection.</li>
            <li>Establish an end-to-end solution integrating TensorFlow, OpenCV, and Flask for seamless deployment.</li>
            <li>Provide a user-friendly interface allowing users to upload images and visualize detection results.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>This project aims to showcase the potential applications of machine learning in target identification scenarios and serve as a foundation for further research and development in computer vision and automated surveillance systems.</p>
